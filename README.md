Goal of this fork
-------------------------

* modifying the x-end idler to more solid, right now the ball-bearing mount it's a predetermined breaking point.
* modifying the wood frame fins to fit the i3 EINSTEIN Rework y-corners
* modifying the y-carrier for 3-point leveling AND for triggering the lower y-endstop even if the bed is mounted a few mm higher (i.e. due to leveling screws)
* figuring out something cool for the "i3" logo that is more universal in terms of milling and laser cutting. If someone has to change the milling tool for engraving the fine "i3" you're probably just gonna leave it and mill the Prusa. New version is supposed to be milled with max. 2 different tools with a minimum diameter of 3mm for hard materials like aluminium or HPL. If Josef allows it, I'll write Proosha III on it, giving the build a linguistic educational flavor :).
