Goal of this fork
-------------------------

* modifying the x-end idler to more solid, right now the ball-bearing mount it's a predetermined breaking point.
* modifying the wood frame fins to fit the i3 EINSTEIN Rework y-corners
* modifying the y-carrier for 3-point leveling AND for triggering the lower y-endstop even if the bed is mounted a few mm higher (i.e. due to leveling screws)
* if Josef's cool with it, I'll call the fork Proosha IIIo [proosha trio], giving the build a linguistic educational flavor :)
