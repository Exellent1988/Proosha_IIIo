This RepRap is available under GPL license.

This is basically a Prusa i3 Einstein Rework with minor changes such as:

* wood-style frame with fins
* stronger x-end-idler


Building instructions
-------------------------
Instead of the original threaded rod configuration, you need

* 2x Threaded rod M5x300 mm
* 2x Threaded rod M10x210 mm
* 2x Threaded rod M10x365 mm
* 2x Threaded rod M10x380 mm

and a few more M10 nuts and washers plus two M8 x 20 mm screws.

You also need to tap the printed X-END-IDLER-BETTER.stl twice with a M8 x 1,25 thread. Thats where the two M8 x 20 mm screws go.

Besides that, just follow the instructions from [the original project page](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3_Rework_Introduction/de)


Roadmap
-------------------------

- [x] modifying the x-end idler to more solid, right now the ball-bearing mount it's a predetermined breaking point
- [x] modifying the wood frame fins to fit the i3 EINSTEIN Rework y-corners and 10mm threaded rods
- [ ] modifying the y-carrier for 3-point leveling AND for triggering the lower y-endstop even if the bed is mounted a few mm higher (i.e. due to leveling screws)
